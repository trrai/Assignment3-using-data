# a3 - Using Data

This repo contains practice R code, created as part of an assignment for the [Technical Foundations](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100121) course at the UW iSchool.

The below questions should be answered regarding your assignment submission!

#### Write your answers to the "Food for thought" questions here:
**1.** I think Afghanistan holding the lowest life expectancy in 2013 shows the state of the middle east at the time. Most likely struck by war or chaos, the environment in Afghanistan was something to avoid.  

**2.** The male crew had the highest frequency of loss out of all of the groups. I think this shows that the passengers were evacuated first and the crew members put the lives of their passengers before their own.

**3.** Looking at the data printed from the SurvivalRate function, it's clear to see that the "women and children first" policy was more heavily applied in the higher classes. The percentage of survival for women and children significantly decreases as the classes go lower.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
I worked with Tony to compare if our functions outputted the same thing.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
I spent about 4-5 hours on this assignment.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
This was definitely more dense than the other two assignments but I'd give it a 7/10 for difficulty.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
The wording for the last problem sort of confused me with figuring out what "women and children" and "men" applied to in terms of the categories in the database.
